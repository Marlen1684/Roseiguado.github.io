# About Me

My name is Rosalba Iguado I was born in Chihuahua city in Mexico on November 13, 1983. I am a single mother with 2 precious little boys. I have a technical degree in Bilingual Administrative Assistant in Mexico. MY job experience is mostly in customer service. I worked at UPS Air Freight as a Data III agent sending shipments daily by air and making sure the shipments arrived to final destination on time. I have also worked for call centers in different areas like Microsoft Money technical support and I helped customers troubleshooting error issues in their computers over the phone. I have accounting and HR experience as well; and my last job was a self employee working as a housekeeper where I was able to build really good relationships with my clients and that has motivated me to do more things and to help others by giving the best of me. I am very happy to be part of the CTRL+SHIFT Code School program, and I am very excited for the new opportunities and new challenges in my life.

# Goals

My biggest goal in life is enjoying life with my family; doing anything that makes me happy. I want to have my own business and work for a good company taking new challenges where I can use all my knowledge to perform a good job and have the satisfaction that I can be really good at anything I do. My personal goal is traveling and discovering the world.

# Learning about Coding
There are three different data types:
1. Numbers (mynumber=150;)
2. Strings (Mystring='hello';)
3. Booleans (Mybool=true;)

# Operators
Different symbols like + that represent an operator for addition
Variables
(apples, my-apples, answer)
Comparisson Operators
Compare values and they evaluate to a True or False

Authentic operators are used to make calculations
Functions
Sequence of instructions & name
makesandwich=Function
"ham" "cheese" = arguments
Values (parameters)
Topping 1
Topping 2

Control Flow control structures they include:
Conditional (describe right conditions in which to use each set)
Loop (Repeat a sound a number of times)
Exceptions (if it is incorrect it will reject the action)

# October 2nd
I have been working on CodeAcademy and seting up my Linked-in account, Twitter, Github.

# October 3rd
watched "How does internet works"
working on Code Academy "For Loops"
Count Controlled loops
While loops (condition controlled loops repeat until a condition changes)
For each loops (Collection controlled loops, repeat for each iterm in a collection).
List is an ordered sequence of info (Adding items to a list after is created)
Appending is when we add things to the end of an existing list, we say we are appendig them to an existing list.
You can accces a item by its index position
You can append items to the end or middle
You can remove items from end to middle.
MARK DOWN
is a way to style texts on the web to formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists.

Organizing your learning
Buffet of Learning:
Trello
mobile apps
priotitize tasks 
React learning board for things I can watch or see later
Trello board
Platforms
Newsletters
fullstack React
Dev. to

AGILE
Is a way to manage projects for software development and it breaks down larger projects into small.

Gearing Up - Odin Project
Learning concepts and then practicing them will help you fully understand how things work and fit together.

FIVER 
Is a website to find people who can help you create a website.

We can use Code editors as a tool to automatically edit codes that where we miss a simple symbol or character, and the most pospular free code editor is VS Code.

# Command line basics
 The black screen or window CLI is like our base operations from which we can launch other programs and interact with them.
 
 To open a terminal CTRL+ALT+T
  $ this is a terminal command and it always begins with this $ symbol.
  
# Exercise

1. Create a new directory in your home directory with the name test
   $ cd test
2. Navigate to test directory
   /test$
3. Create new file called test.txt using touch or echo comands
   $touch test.txt
4. Navigate back out of the test directory
   test$cd ..
5. Delete test directory
   $dir
   $rm -r test
6. Display the name of the directory
   $pwd
7. Create a new directory
   $mkdir
8. Destroy directory file
   $rm -r test (if the folder is not empty)
   rmdir test (if the folder is empty
9. Renama a directory or file
   $mv test.txt

# Git Basics
1. A Git clone command is used to get a full copy of an existing git repository from gitHub
   git clone git@github.com:<your-repository-home> to clone a gitHub repository onto your computer.
2. Use git status command to see any changes made since your last commit
3. Use git add to track files with git
4. Use git commit command to commit files
5. Use git log to view your commit history
6. Use git push command to upload projects on GitHub
7. There are 2 stage system that Git uses to save files add and commit.
   Staging: git add (to save the changes you select)
   Commiting: -m (message) " " (commit message inside quotation marks)
   git commit -m "add readme.md".
8. Origin is a placeholder name for the URL of the remote repository
   Use origin to access remote repository without entering a full URL everytime.
9. Master is the branch of the remote repository you want to push your changes to.

# Git Vs GitHub 

The difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a version control system and GitHub is a development platform to store your documents .

Repository is all the things that go on your file.

Directory is a folder.

Fork is making a copy of another repository in GitHub

Clone is to make a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

Branch is a command that helps you create, delete and list branches in your repository or remote.

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you pulled to a branch in a repository in GitHub.

Learning how to create a Pull Request from a fork.

We watched the Youtube tutorial video Pull Request and we followed through the steps and did one on our own:

https://classroom.google.com/w/MzU5MjY3MzM1NTda/tc/MzU5MjQwNDQwMzRa

Our Guess speaker Tyler Moody talked about Git Strategies:

Git
  Command tool
  Integration with source controls like Gitbucket which this one is very popular for a lot of companies in OKC.

Gitignore
  This informs git what you don't want to have outhere. Anything you don't want publicity visible.
  
Readme.md
  One of the first paces that dev is going to look.
  
Gitfolder
  Every time youj do a pull against a local it saves the changes.
  
Branching Strategy
  Traditional strategy when creating branches:
    Features
    Bugfix
    per card
Creating a branch
  git checkout -b cool-branch

The Good, Bad and Ugly

Good
  Fature branches
  Pull requests
Bad
  Merging
Ugly
  Merge conflicts

Merging Branches allows you to move changes from bfanch to branch.

GIT Rebase
 2 ways to do it:
 directly git rebase
 git pull --rebase

Note: Never edit in source control directly and never rebase against master.

GIT BRANCHES

git checkout
git commit
git branch -b (name for the branch)
git merge

GIT HEAD

git checkout c1
git checkout master
git commit
git checkout c2 
detaching HEAD means attaching it to a commit instead of a branch.
example: Head-master-c1

Relative Refs
In git instead of typing the whole hash fe2bcfedkdkejehehwe you type in the first 4 letters fed2
Relative commits
To move upwards one commit at a time with ^.
To move upqwards a number dof ltimes with ~<num>
master ^ first parent of the master
master ^^ grandparent of master

HTML & CSS

Every project has to have an index.html
Always use lower case for naming or editing folders and files
Open your visual studio
create a new folder
create a about.html file
create a index.html file
create a new folder name CSS
Create a style.css file

To commit html in github open a command line from the folder you created
git innit
git add .
git commit -m

Animations
Timelines and playback control Sag/css/Js

Properties like a transform to animate

Available animation:

Firegox, and Opera have foundation implementated
Safari is very close in Tech preview of behind a flag
Edge will be blink soon

Create an animation
Transitioning fro one state to another
A tiing function

Animating multiple frames and properties
key frames

It has an equivalent in CSS
Beneffits as compositor layer
variables
finer control

Control and play states

If's you want to see how far away you are in an animation that is player timeline.

Playback rate fives a lot of power to play it faster

EVENTS
onfinish oncancel
Games that uses animation

Interacting with multiple animations.

What is IOT
Printers, smart thermostats, smart lights, cars, appliances, phones etc.,

Prevent hackers

IOT is everywhere
It's growing quickly as mpore devices get in the network

MS08-06 2008 devices were infected with conficker. They had to find hatches to fix the devices.

Domain Admin was applied in printers. Hackers got access to it with default credentials. Hplaserjet M4345 insecurely returns the password in the clients HTTp response. Since it was domain admin it was harde to fix.

Meteobridge webb weather web interface. Weather underground insecure passwords were easy to get in and more chances to hack.

Highly recommend to a non default value. No encryption at all.

Lessons learned:
Change default password
Apply media and software patches
Isolate IOT from trusted networks
Network access least privileges con be affected
Apply firmware and software patches
Isolate these devices from other networks

Miral Botnet
Uses a table of 60 factory default usernames
Isolate IOT from the internet
Change default password

Another default password mistake
1234567812345678

Konica Minolta Bizhub
Change LDAP server address to the pen test system.

Address Book
64 usernames and email addresses. With that you can launch a password spray attack against the user list.

Encouraging users to make passwords long to prevent these kind of attacks in the network.

Veeder Root
Keep your data secure with FTS
Vulnerable to shellshack
Can run commands on the webserver

IPMI devices
Out of band management for servers
Intelligent Platform management. Allows you to do lthings from the command line IPMI ipmitool.

Cipherzero should be disable to prevent anytype of attacks.

Remote Hash Retrieval vulnerability it cannot be patched.

We need a mental model
#1 defensive layers
#2 attack surface
#3 least privilege

Cybersecurity
Identifying your IOT
Detect issues that arent resolved
