Learning about Coding
There are three different data types:
1. Numbers (mynumber=150;)
2. Strings (Mystring='hello';)
3. Booleans (Mybool=true;)

Operators
Different symbols like + that represent an operator for addition
Variables
(apples, my-apples, answer)
Comparisson Operators
Compare values and they evaluate to a True or False
Authentic operators are used to make calculations
Functions
Sequence of instructions & name
makesandwich=Function
"ham" "cheese" = arguments
Values (parameters)
Topping 1
Topping 2

Control Flow control structures they include:
Conditional (describe right conditions in which to use each set)
Loop (Repeat a sound a number of times)
Exceptions (if it is incorrect it will reject the action)

October 2nd I have been working on CodeAcademy and seting up my Linked-in account, Twitter, Github.
